# Bracketfuck
This is a standard-issue brainfuck interpreter, with the only modification being to replace the non-bracket characters of standard brainfuck with brackets. This interpreter therefore makes the following switches:
- `+` is spelt `(`
- `-` is spelt `)`
- `.` is spelt `{`
- `,` is spelt `}`
